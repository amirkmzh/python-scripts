# python-scripts
Some of my useful python shell scripts ...

## check_mysql_connction
In this script, we have an URI as the input. Then we validate the connection and declare the connection result. You can access more info in the related `README.md` file. 

## looper

The Looper script runs a bash command with fixed intervals and tries untill it gets appropriate result. If the result was correct, the code returns 0 and prints success message in `stdout`. Otherwise, it prints error message in `stderr`.
